# British-Airways-Data-Science-Project

Title: British Airways Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Project

Description:
This repository contains the project I completed as part of British Airways' job simulation on the Forage platform. The project focuses on analyzing customer insights and building a predictive model to understand the factors influencing customer booking behavior.

Key Features:

Web Scraping: Collected customer reviews using BeautifulSoup to extract insights from real-world data.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepared messy, unstructured data for analysis through tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Sentiment Analysis: Performed sentiment classification using the VADER sentiment analyzer and visualized results with pie charts.

Feature Engineering: Applied techniques such as one-hot encoding and MinMax scaling for effective feature representation.

Predictive Modeling: Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict booking behavior and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy and AUC score.

Visualization: Presented insights using word clouds, bar charts, and other visualizations.

Learnings: Gained hands-on experience in machine learning model creation, evaluation, and working with real British Airways data.

Tools and Technologies:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
NLTK, VADER Sentiment Analyzer
scikit-learn
Matplotlib, WordCloud
Jupyter Notebook

Outcome:
This project provided practical exposure to data analysis, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling in a real-world context. It helped me develop strong technical and communication skills, confirming my passion for leveraging data to provide business insights.
